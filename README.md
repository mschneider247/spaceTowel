### Call me Mike!

A curious soul inspired by Europe's castles and forests. I embraced storytelling through Dungeons and Dragons and experimented with paper flight contraptions, 
fostering a love for iterative testing. Influenced by Leonardo, Brunelleschi, and Einstein, I explored history firsthand. A voracious reader, "The Hobbit" and 
"Ender's Game" were childhood favorites. My parents' government roles offered unique insights into life overseas. At Iowa State, I immersed myself in diverse studies, 
from Computer Engineering to Ballet. The American Dance Festival honed my artistic talents. Now, as a software engineer, author, and artist, I continue my journey 
of exploration and creativity. Join me on this adventure of life!
